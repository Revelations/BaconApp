		<p>
			Kiwi are flightless birds native to New Zealand.
			At around the size of a chicken, kiwi are a particularly small, flightless bird. They are particularly unusual in the fact they lay a very large egg, in fact taking up 20% of their body mass.
			There are five recognised species, all of which are endangered. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is from predators many of which have introduced since colonization. These predators include
			stoats, cats, possums, and even wild pigs are known to enjoy the taste of kiwi eggs. Please note that the kiwi is a nocturnal bird, meaning they are most active at night.
