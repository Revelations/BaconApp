				<h3>Tui</h3>
							<p>
								The Tui is a native bird to New Zealand. It is one of the largest members of the diverse honeyeater family.  The name tui is from the Maori language name tui and is the species' formal common name.
								The English name, Parson Bird, has fallen into disuse but came about because at first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch,
								causing it to resemble a parson in clerical attire. Tuis are considered to be very intelligent, much like parrots. They also resemble parrots in their ability to imitate sounds, and are known for their noisy,
								unusual call, different for each individual.
