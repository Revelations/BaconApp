<!--

NOTE: The marker doesn't get moved on Chrome 14 for some reason. Use FireFox for now.

Also, the example page from http://www.schepers.cc/svg/params/params.html
	renders perfectly fine on Chrome (shows colours, and "stop", "fast", "go" as text), 
	yet when the page is saved to local disk, it does not call the script
	(hence showing a black circle, and UNDEFINED text).
	
	This issue is not prominent in Firefox.
