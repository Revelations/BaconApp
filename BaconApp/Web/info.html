						<h3> Kiwis</h3>
						<p>
							Kiwi are flightless birds native to New Zealand.
							At around the size of a chicken, kiwi are a particularly small, flightless bird. They are particularly unusual in the fact they lay a very large egg, in fact taking up 20% of their body mass.
							There are five recognised species, all of which are endangered. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is from predators many of which have introduced since colonization. These predators include
							stoats, cats, possums, and even wild pigs are known to enjoy the taste of kiwi eggs. Please note that the kiwi is a nocturnal bird, meaning they are most active at night.

							<h3>Tui</h3>
							<p>
								The tui is native to New Zealand. It is one of the largest members of the diverse honeyeater family.  The name tui is from the Maori language name tui and is the species' formal common name.
								The English name, Parson Bird, has fallen into disuse but came about because at first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch,
								causing it to resemble a parson in clerical attire. Tuis are considered to be very intelligent, much like parrots. They also resemble parrots in their ability to imitate sounds, and are known for their noisy,
								unusual call, different for each individual.

							<h3>Weta</h3>
							<p>
								Many weta are large by insect standards and some varieties of Weta are among the largest and heaviest in the world. Their physical appearance is like a  a cricket, but the hind legs are enlarged and usually very spiny. 
								All New Zealand Weta are wingless, and can be foundi n a variety of environments including alpine, forests, grasslands, caves, shrub lands and urban gardens. 
								They are nocturnal, and some prey on other invertebrates, but the tree and giant Weta eat mostly lichens, leaves, flowers, seed-heads and fruit.The weta's lifestyle and habitat, where it may choose to remain
								concealed in suburban environments until unexpectedly confronted, combined with its notoriously unfriendly appearance, make it a frequent victim of irrational human aggression.
								Although the weta had native predators in the form of birds (especially the weka and kiwi), reptiles and bats before the arrival of humans, introduced species such as cats, hedgehogs, rats have caused a 
								sharp decrease in their numbers. They are also vulnerable to habitat destruction caused by humans and modification of their habitat caused by introduced browsers(ie cattle). 
								New Zealand’s Department of Conservation considers that 16 of the 70 species of weta are now at risk. Some examples of especially endangered species are even tracked by radio beacons.
